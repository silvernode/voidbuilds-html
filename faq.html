		<h1>F.A.Q</h1>
		<p style="color: #FFFFFF">
			<font style="color: yellow">Q:</font> Do you do anything special to your ISO files?</br>
			<font style="color: cyan">A:</font> Only packages are added to the ISO files, nothing more.</br></br>

			Q: When will you add new images to the lineup?</br>
			A: Currently the server can only hold the existing images due to lack of storage.</br>
			This is the primary reason I take donations since I get a lot of requests for new images.</br></br>

			Q: Why do images take so long to build?</br>
			A: Void Builds is hosted on a single core VPS and this limits how fast images can be built</br></br>

			Q: I am having problems with your images, can you fix it?</br>
			A: This depends on the problem; if a missing package is the cause then I can add that package.</br>
			However, I cannot fix issues that are more complex due to lack of skills.</br></br>

			Q: What build scripts do you use?</br>
			A: I have written a bash script with a series of functions that perform states of the build</br>
			Some functions output information to the build status page while others do key signing.</br>
			Each image flavor also has its own script which makes use of the <a href="https://github.com/void-linux/void-mklive">void-mklive</a> scripts.</br>
			I plan to revise and rework my custom scripts at some point to use less bashisms and make them easier to maintain.</br></br>

			Q: Why does your website look like it came from the 1990s?<br>
			A: This is a good question, and the short answer is that I am not a web developer.<br>
			I also did not want a website that takes ages to load with complex scripts and difficult navigation.</br></br>
